# Lang-app With **ONLY NATIVE** [Javascript] OR [PHP]
Config a multi lang in your app both with PHP or JS

## How it work?
Once the request to access a page is made, if the user didn't select any language, a default one is selected(french actually). Considering the user selected a language before, next requests will just reuse his choice which is even saved in the session.

**All is contextual, meaning the visitor will remain on the same page with a different language.**
## What do you want to choose?
